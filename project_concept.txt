= 	Game States (start, running, paused, game_over):
-	game states will be updated in some fps by timer interrupts.

= 	3 buttons (handled by interrupts):
-	when game state is in a menu screen ('start', 'paused' or 'game_over'),
	the buttons should be used to interact with menu itens (up, down, select) and
	when the game is running, the buttons should be used to fire and pause the game.
	- 	btn0: up		/	fire_A
	- 	btn1: down		/	fire_B
	- 	btn2: select	/	pause
	
=	joystick (polled on each game state change):
-	detect the direction (dx, dy) of movement to change the player position.

=	Animation:
-	a global variable should count the current frame number on a cyclic manner (count % limit)
	to create bitmap animation on each game state change.
	
=	Objects (player, enemies, power ups, lasers, bosses, etc):
-	all objects should be instantiated in the begining og the code with:
	- integer position (x, y)
	- visible state (on/off)
	- other attributes such as hp, etc
	this should be done to avoid running out of memory during the game and possibly crashing it...
	
=	Sound Effects (PWM):
-	setup a PWM with 50% DC and change its frequency on each game state change
	to form a sound effect.
	
=	Light Effects (SSI):
-	setup SSI to handle the ws2812b (or equivalent) led strip to create light effects,
	which should be updated each game state change.
